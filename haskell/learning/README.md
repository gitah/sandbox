Introduction
============

This folder contains the exercises I've done to learn Haskell from the book
[Learn you a Haskell For Great Good](http://learnyouahaskell.com/)

Each file is for a different chapter.

After going through the book, I found Haskell to be a pretty boss language.
List comprehensions and pattern matching in functions is pretty awesome.
